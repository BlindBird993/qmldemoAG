Simulation of several types of splines and surfaces using Gmlib library for Geometrical modeling

This simulation created using C++, Qt Creator and GMlib library.

The purpose of this project was to study different aspects of applied geometry and implement several curves and surfaces. 
During the work the following tasks were done:

- Implementation of our own version of a 2nd degree B-spline curve.
- Implementation of curve resulting from blending two curves with a B-function over a given part of the two curves.
- Implementation of model curve for the simulation.
- Implementation of version of a GERBS curve of blending spline type.
- Using affine transformations of local curves to make a dynamic visual special effect.
- Implementation of version of a GERBS surface of blending spline type.
